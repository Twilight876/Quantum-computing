# File Organizer (CS50 Week 6 skills + automation)
import os
import shutil
downloads_folder = "/path/to/Downloads"
destinations = {
    "pdf": "/Documents/PDFs",
    "jpg": "/Pictures",
    "zip": "/Archives"
}
for filename in os.listdir(downloads_folder):
    file_ext = filename.split(".")[-1].lower()
    if file_ext in destinations:
        src = os.path.join(downloads_folder, filename)
        dest = os.path.join(destinations[file_ext], filename)
        shutil.move(src, dest)
print("Files organized! 🚀")
```

🎯 **Final Tips**
