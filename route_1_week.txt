🗓️ 1-Week Power Plan (CS50 + Automation)

Goal: Complete the most relevant parts of CS50 while building automation scripts to feel immediate progress.
Day 1–2: CS50’s Python + Automation Basics

    CS50: Skip to Week 6 (Python). Focus on:

        Python syntax, loops, functions, and file I/O.

        Libraries like sys, os, and re (regex).

    Automation Project:

        Build a file organizer (sort files by type/date).

        Use Python’s os and shutil to automate folder cleanup.

Day 3–4: CS50 Algorithms + Web Automation

    CS50: Watch Week 3 (Algorithms) for Big O, search/sort.

    Automation Project:

        Scrape a website (e.g., weather data) using Python’s requests and BeautifulSoup.

        Save results to a CSV/Excel file.

Day 5–6: CS50 SQL + Advanced Automation

    CS50: Study Week 7 (SQL). Learn to query databases.

    Automation Project:

        Automate a database backup script (Python + SQL).

        Use cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run it daily.

Day 7: Quantum Prep + Mini-Project

    Quantum Computing: Spend 1–2 hours on conceptual basics:

        Watch Quantum Computing in 5 Minutes.

        Learn the difference between bits (0/1) and qubits (superposition).

    Automation Project:

        Combine all skills: Scrape data → clean it with Python → save to SQL → automate the workflow.

💡 Why This Works

    CS50’s Python/SQL Focus: These are directly applicable to automation and quantum computing (most quantum frameworks use Python).

    Automation = Quick Wins: Building scripts gives you tangible results fast, boosting confidence.

    Quantum Foundations: Even a small intro to qubits primes your brain for future learning.

🚀 Post-Vacation Quantum Roadmap

After your vacation, transition smoothly into quantum computing with:

    Math Prep:

        Linear Algebra: 3Blue1Brown’s Essence of Linear Algebra (short, visual).

        Probability: Khan Academy’s Probability Course.

    Quantum Tools:

        Start with Qiskit (Python library) and IBM’s free quantum simulators.

    Projects:

        Code a simple quantum circuit (e.g., create superposition).

⚡ Automation Skills That Directly Help Quantum

    Python Scripting: Qiskit/Cirq use Python for quantum programming.

    Data Handling: Automating data cleanup/prep is critical for quantum experiments.

    Workflow Efficiency: Use automation to run quantum simulations in the cloud (e.g., AWS/Azure).

📝 Sample Automation Script (Python)
python
Copy

# File Organizer (CS50 Week 6 skills + automation)
import os
import shutil

downloads_folder = "/path/to/Downloads"
destinations = {
    "pdf": "/Documents/PDFs",
    "jpg": "/Pictures",
    "zip": "/Archives"
}

for filename in os.listdir(downloads_folder):
    file_ext = filename.split(".")[-1].lower()
    if file_ext in destinations:
        src = os.path.join(downloads_folder, filename)
        dest = os.path.join(destinations[file_ext], filename)
        shutil.move(src, dest)
print("Files organized! 🚀")

🎯 Final Tips

    Focus on Momentum: Even 2–3 hours/day will compound.

    Use AI Tools: ChatGPT/GitHub Copilot can debug code or explain quantum concepts.

    Celebrate Small Wins: Every script you write is a step toward "feeling powerful."

You’ll finish your vacation with coding confidence, automation superpowers, and a clear path to quantum computing. Let me know if you want project ideas or CS50 shortcuts! 😊
